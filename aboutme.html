            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h3>I used to think, "It would be really cool if I could make stickers of whatever I want." And now I can!</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                It started with my interest in customizing my own stuff. I wanted to buy stickers or keychains or merch from my favorite games or shows, but they were all so expensive! I then realized that stickers are some of the cheapest products to buy for customizing stuff. Then, with some research, I realized I had the resourses to make my own! I went out and bought sticker paper that I could put in my printer and started exploring. I was finally able to make a sticker of whatever I wanted!
                <br><br>
                After making a few stickers, I thought about making money with them. I could sell my stickers to friends and family to pay back the money I spent on supplies. My buisness was successful and it helped me save up for a few things I wanted. There was only one problem: The stickers didn't last long and I noticed that they started to fade. I fixed this problem by manualy laminating my stickers with clear packing tape. This made my stickers last much longer and look better too!
                <br><br>
                I am now taking a class in web development, and I thought it would be a great idea to make a website for my sticker buisness! This way, I can reach more people and make it easier for them to order stickers from me! Please contact me if you're interested in purchasing some of my custom stickers! I look forward to hearing from you and what designs you would want to have on a sticker.
