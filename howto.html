            <h3>I used to think, "It would be really cool if I could make stickers of whatever I want." And now I can!</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                It started with my interest in customizing my own stuff. I wanted to buy stickers or keychains or merch from my favorite games or shows, but they were all so expensive! I then realized I had the resourses to make my own stickers. I bought some sticker paper and I was finally able to make a sticker of whatever I wanted!
                <br><br>
                After making a few stickers, I thought about making money with them. My buisness was successful and it helped me save up for a few things.
                <br><br>
                After taking a class in web development, I started to make this website to expand my buisness. Please contact me if you're interested in purchasing some of my custom stickers! I look forward to hearing from you and what designs you would want to have on a sticker.
